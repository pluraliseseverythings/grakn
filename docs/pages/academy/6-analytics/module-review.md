You have almost completed the GRAKN Academy. Only a bunch of exercises left to do!

### Exercise 1: OLAP and OLTP queries

What is the difference between an OLAP and an OLTP query? Can you make an example of each in Graql?

### Exercise 2: Count queries

Write a `compute count` query that tells you how many countries are in the academy dataset and run it in the Dashboard.

### Exercise 3: Statistics queries

Use Graql analytics to find:

  1. The average risk of a bond
  2. The maximum distance from the coast of an oil platform

### Exercise 4: Compute queries and aggregates

What are the differences between compute queries and aggregate queries? When you should use each one?

### Exercise 5: Shortest paths

Find the shortest path between the region named "Africa" and the company named "BP". Use the graphical interfaces (i.e. the graph visualiser).

### Exercise 6: Degree queries

Use a `compute degrees` query to find how many countries are contained in each region. Copy the ID of the region with the most countries and verify in the graph visualiser that it is EUROPE by running the query

```
match $x id REGION_ID; get;
```

### Exercise 7: Cluster queries

Find clusters of companies, bonds and `issues` relationships and verify that they are more or less evenly distributed (that is, every company issues more or less the same number of bonds).
