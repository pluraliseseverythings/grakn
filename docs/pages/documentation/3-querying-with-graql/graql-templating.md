## Basic Syntax
 
Graql templates are Graql statements with the addition of functions and variables. Graql templates are primarily used for migrating data into Grakn, although as a component of Graql, they can be used whevever writing Graql in Java. You can find more examples of their usage in the [Migration](../migration/migration-overview.html) section of the documentation. 

{% include note.html content=" For the moment, Graql Template usage is limited to Graql Java. It will not work in the Graql shell. " %}

Templates are used to expand Graql queries, given data. They allow you to control the flow of information.

Accessing a single value:

```graql-template
$x isa thing has val <value>
```

Value in a nested context:

```graql-template
$x isa person has name <person.name.firstName>
```

## Replacement

Replacement occurs inside the `<` `>` characters or when executing a macro that is not a condition. 

{% include note.html content=" When replacing values in the output, the templating engine will automatically surround any `string` in quotes. It will not for any `int`, `double` or `boolean` " %}

A quick example of what the replacement looks like:

```graql-template
first is a <string>, second a <long>, third a <double>, fourth a <boolean>
```

```text
first is a "string", second a 40, third a 0.001, fourth a false
```

### Unsupported symbols

The templating language requires that non-alphanumeric (plus `-`) symbols in any data key be quoted. 

```graql-template
insert $x has description <"ple@s3D0ntD0Th!sT0Y0urself">;
```

If you need to nest keys with invalid symbols you need to quote each individual key:

```graql-template
insert $x has description <"ple@s3".D0nt.D0."Th!s".T0.Y0urself>;
```

For a list of the reserved keywords, see the bottom of this page. 

## Logic 

### Expressions

Expressions can be used as the conditions in `if`/`elseif` statements or as the contents of `macro` statements. 

#### Boolean expressions

Boolean expressions operate over `true` and `false`.

|  Expression | Usage | 
|-------------|---| 
| `and`       |  `if (<this> and <that>) do { ... }` |
| `or`        |  `if (<this> or <that>) do { ... }` |
| `not`       |  `if (not <this>) do { ... }` | 

#### Comparisons

|  Expression | Usage | Notes
|-------------|---| --- |
| `=`         |  `if (<this> = <that>) do { ... }` |
| `!=`        |  `if (<this> != <that>) do { ... }` |
| `>`         |  `if (<this> > <that>) do { ... }` | operates on numbers
| `>=`        |  `if (<this> >= <that>) do { ... }` | operates on numbers
| `<`         |  `if (<this> < <that>) do { ... }` | operates on numbers
| `<=`        |  `if (<this> <= <that>) do { ... }` | operates on numbers

### Conditionals 

`if`, `else` and `elseif` are the included commands that provide conditional logic. 

**`if` statements**:

```graql-template
if (<surname> != null)
do { insert $x has surname <surname>; }
```

**`if`...`else`**

```graql-template
if ( <born> != null) 
do { insert $x has birth-date <born>; } 
else { insert $x; }
```

#### Groups

Parenthesis can be used to group conditionals together. 

```graql-template
if( (first <= second) or (not (third <= second))) 
do { insert isa y; } 
else { insert isa z; }
```

### Iteration

Graql Templates allow you to iterate over maps or lists.

**For loop over a list**

```graql-template
insert
    for (name in <names>)
    do { 
        $x has name <name>; 
    }
```

**For loop over a map**

```graql-template
insert $x isa person;
    for (address in <addresses>) do {
        $x has street <address.street>
    };
```

**Enhanced `for` loop over a map** In this type of loop it is not required to provide the item name. The properties within the `do` block context are inferred to be the first level children of the property in the `for` statement.

```graql-template
insert $x isa person;
    for (<addresses>) do {
        $x has street <street> ;
    }
```

**Doubly nested `for`**

```graql-template
insert

for (<people>) do { 
$x isa person has name <name>;
    for (<addresses>) do {
    $y isa address ;
        $y has street <street> ;
        $y has number <number> ;
        ($x, $y) isa resides;
    }
}
```

### Array Accessors

Graql templates allow you to access an element at a specific index in a given list. This is denoted by the square brackets surrounding the desired index `[0]`. 

**Accessing the first element** of an array.
```graql-template
insert $x has name <names[0]>;
```

**Two dimentional arrays** where data is stored in arrays of arrays.
```graql-template
// to get the first dish in the first course of the meal 
insert $x isa first-course has dish <course[0][1]>;
```

### Macros

Macros are denoted by an `@` symbol prefixing the name of the macro function. 

**`noescp`**  is short for "no escape". This function will not add quotes or escape the characters inside the value when doing replacement. Exactly one argument accepted. Returns a string.

```graql-template
insert $x isa @noescp(<species>)-species;
```

**`int`** converts the contents of the data to an integer. Exactly one argument accepted. 

```graql-template
match $x isa thing has val @int(<value>);
```

**`long`** converts the contents of the data to an long. Exactly one argument accepted. 

```graql-template
match $x isa thing has val @long(<value>);
```

**`double`** converts the contents of the data to a double. Exactly one argument accepted. 

```graql-template
match $x isa thing has val @double(<value>);
```

**`boolean`** converts the contents of the data to a boolean. Exactly one argument accepted. 

```graql-template
match $x isa thing has val @boolean(<value>);
```

**`equals`** returns a boolean with a value specified by the gievn string. The boolean represents a `true` value if the string argumetn is not null and is equal, ignoring case, to the string "true". Can be used in conditional statements. Requires at least two arguments. 

```graql-template
insert $x isa thing val @equals(<this>, <that>, <other>)
```

```graql-template
if (@equals(<this>, <that>)) do { equals }"
```

**`date`** `(<value>, fromFormat)` converts a date string from the given format to the supported Graql date format. Date format specifications can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html). Returns a string. 

```graql-template
insert $x val @date(<date>, "mm/dd/yyyy"d);
```

**`lower`** converts the contents of the data to lower case. 

```graql-template
match $x isa thing has val @lower(<value>);
```

**`upper`** converts the contents of the data to upper case.

```graql-template
match $x isa thing has val @upper(<value>);
```

**`split`** splits the given string around the matches of the given regular expression. More information about regular expressions can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum). Returns a list of strings.

```graql-template
insert $x 
    for (val in @split(<list>, ",")) do { 
        has description <val>
    };
```

**`concat`** concatenates all of the given arguments into a single string. If the arguments are not strings, it converts them to strings before concatenating. Returns a string.

```graql-template
insert $x has val @concat(<forname>, " ", <surname>);
```

#### Nesting macros

When writing a template, you can nest macros inside other macros. When doing so, you're using the results of the nested macros as arguments to the enclosing ones. 

For example, the `split` macro returns strings, but people may want to convert one of the values as a long. If that is the case you can:

```graql-template
insert $x val @long(@split(<list>, ",")[0]);
```

#### User-defined Macros

The described macros are built-in to Graql templating language. Grakn provides an interface that a user should extend in java to implement custom macros. The user should then register the created macro with the `QueryBuilder` class. 

### Scopes

During iteration Graql variables will be automatically suffixed with an index.  

For example, the following loop:

```graql-template
insert
	$p isa person has identifier <pid>
		has firstname <name1>,
		
		if (<surname> != "") do 
		{
		has surname <surname>,
		}

		if (<name2> != "") do 
		{
		has middlename <name2>,
		}
		
		if (<age> != "") do 
		{
		has age @long(<age>),
		}

		if (<born> != "") do 
		{
		has birth-date <born>,
		}

		if (<dead> != "") do 
		{
		has death-date <dead>,
		}

		has gender <gender>;
```

would result in the expanded Graql queries:

```graql
# ...
insert $p0 isa person has firstname "Barbara" has identifier "Barbara Newman" has surname "Newman" has gender "female";
insert $p1 has birth-date "1811-03-06" isa person has surname "Newman" has gender "male" has death-date "1898-09-10" has identifier "Henry Newman" has age 87 has firstname "Henry";
# ...
```
