# Address to bind to and tell other Cassandra nodes to factory to. You
# _must_ change this if you want multiple nodes to be able to
# communicate!
#
# Leaving it blank leaves it up to InetAddress.getLocalHost(). This
# will always do the Right Thing _if_ the node is properly configured
# (hostname, name resolution, etc), and the Right Thing is to use the
# address associated with the hostname (it might not be).
#
# Setting this to 0.0.0.0 is always wrong.
listen_address: listen_address-original

# The address to bind the Thrift RPC service and native transport
# server -- clients factory here.
#
# Leaving this blank has the same effect it does for ListenAddress,
# (i.e. it will be based on the configured hostname of the node).
#
# Note that unlike ListenAddress above, it is allowed to specify 0.0.0.0
# here if you want to listen on all interfaces, but that will break clients
# that rely on node auto-discovery.

# any class that implements the SeedProvider interface and has a
# constructor that takes a Map<String, String> of parameters will do.
seed_provider:
    # Addresses of hosts that are deemed contact points.
    # Cassandra nodes use this list of hosts to find each other and learn
    # the topology of the ring.  You must change this if you are running
    # multiple nodes!

# This defines the number of tokens randomly assigned to this node on the ring
# The more tokens, relative to other nodes, the larger the proportion of data
# that this node will store. You probably want all nodes to have the same number
# of tokens assuming they have equal hardware capability.
#
# If you leave this unspecified, Cassandra will use the default of 1 token for legacy compatibility,
# and will use the initial_token as described below.
#
# Specifying initial_token will override this setting.
#
# If you already have a cluster with 1 token per node, and wish to migrate to 
# multiple tokens per node, see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations
#
# The default value that ships with Janus is smaller than the default value
# that ships with Apache Cassandra.  Fewer tokens means faster Faunus run
# times on small datasets.  That's convenient when testing Janus(-Hadoop) on
# toy data.  However, increasing num_tokens is strongly recommended for
# production Janus instances backed by Cassandra.  This low value is just
# for development and testing.
num_tokens: 4

# initial_token allows you to specify tokens manually.  While you can use # it with
# vnodes (num_tokens > 1, above) -- in which case you should provide a 
# comma-separated list -- it's primarily used when adding nodes # to legacy clusters 
# that do not have vnodes enabled.
