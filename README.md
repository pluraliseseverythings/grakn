AI systems process knowledge that is too complex for current databases. Grakn is a **hyper-relational** database for **knowledge-oriented** systems. Grakn enables machines to manage complex data that serves as a knowledge base for cognitive/AI systems. Graql is Grakn's Reasoning (through OLTP) and Analytics (through OLAP) Query Language. Graql is a much higher level abstraction over traditional query language - SQL, NoSQL, or Graphs.
