 * keyspace. An element is added to that list when there is an attempt to create
 * a graph from a factory bound to the keyspace name. The list is simply the
 * instances of the system entity type 'keyspace'. Nothing is ever removed from
 * that list. The set of known keyspaces is maintained in a static map so we
 * don't connect to the system keyspace every time a factory produces a new
 * graph. That means that we can't have several different factories (e.g. Janus
 * and in-memory Tinkerpop) at the same time sharing keyspace names. We can't
 * identify the factory builder by engineUrl and config because we don't know
 * what's inside the config, which is residing remotely at the engine!
