//Docs to do @Filipe
/*
    Please can you revisit the documentation above and add any clarification  you think necessary about
    WHY you would want a toy graph (e.g. what would you be doing or not doing to use it)?
    This section of documentation is probably going to be the first place some visitors reach
    if they are classic Java developers and reach for javadocs rather than tutorials on our portal
    Please can you have a think to see if there is anything else this page, the intro, needs?

/**
 <p>
 Grakn is the main entry point to connect to a Grakn Knowledge Base.

 To connect to a knowledge graph, first make sure you have a Grakn Engine server running by starting it from the shell using:
 <pre>{@code grakn server start}</pre>

 To establish a connection, you first need to obtain a {@link GraknSession} by calling
 the {@link #session(String, String)} method. A {@link GraknSession} connects to a given physical
 location and specific database instance within that location.

 Once you've instantiated a session, you can obtain multiple concurrent graph connections,
 represented by the {@link GraknTx} interface.

 If you are running the Grakn server locally then you can initialise a graph with:

 <pre>{@code GraknTx graph = Grakn.session(Grakn.DEFAULT_URI, "keyspace").getGraph();}</pre>
 If you are running the Grakn server remotely you must initialise the graph by providing the IP address of your server:

 <pre>{@code GraknTx graph = Grakn.session("127.6.21.2", "keyspace").getGraph();}</pre>
 The string “keyspace” uniquely identifies the graph and allows you to create different graphs.

 Please note that graph keyspaces are not case sensitive so the following two graphs are actually the same graph:

 <pre>{@code GraknTx graph1 = Grakn.session("127.6.21.2", "keyspace").getGraph();
 GraknTx graph2 = Grakn.session("127.6.21.2", "KeYsPaCe").getGraph();}</pre>
 All graphs are also singletons specific to their keyspaces so be aware that in the following case:

 <pre>{@code GraknTx graph1 = Grakn.session("127.6.21.2", "keyspace").getGraph();
 GraknTx graph2 = Grakn.session("127.6.21.2", "keyspace").getGraph();
 GraknTx graph3 = Grakn.session("127.6.21.2", "keyspace").getGraph();}</pre>

 any changes to <code>graph1</code>, <code>graph2</code>, or <code>graph3</code> will all be persisted to the same graph.

 You can alternatively instantiate a 'toy' knowledge graph (which runs in-memory) for experimentation purposes.
 You can initialise an in memory graph without having the Grakn server running:

 <pre>{@code GraknTx graph = Grakn.session(Grakn.IN_MEMORY, "keyspace").getGraph();}</pre>
 This in memory graph serves as a toy graph for you to become accustomed to the API without needing to setup a
 Grakn Server. It is also useful for testing purposes.
